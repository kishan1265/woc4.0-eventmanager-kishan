This project involves the development of a fully functional web application capable of handling the maximum number of aspects of event management. It is a dynamic website, offering services like event registration, participant registration and dashboards to analyze the available data. It presents itself as a commendable outcome of full-stack web development where i not only designs and decides what the screen would look like but also figures out the logic which leads to the appearance of those things on the screen. The project includes extensive use of GET and POST requests  between the browser and the server in order to make exchange of data possible. Implementation of the database would take care of data storage and retrieval. Interestingly, all these things would run on a local server of your own!

Technologies incorporated:

    Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    Back-end: Django framework (based on Python programming language)
    Database: SQLite (covered in Django, not to be learnt separately)

Concepts involved:
    Class-Object Structure
    Object Relational Mapper (ORM)
    URL Mapping
    View Configuration
    Request Handling
    Page Rendering
